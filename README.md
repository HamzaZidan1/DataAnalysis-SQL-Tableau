Data Processing & Analytical Approach

Ad Strategies: Adjusting ad budgets based on platform popularity among different marital statuses could yield better results.
Limitations
Data integrity is of utmost importance. Notable disparities, such as the low customer count from Montenegro, might introduce bias in the analysis. Efforts should be made to ensure robust data collection and validation.

## Conclusion
A data-driven approach to understanding customer behavior, especially within a diverse marketplace like 2Market, is instrumental. This analysis offers a roadmap for tailoring marketing strategies to align with observed patterns, ensuring more targeted and effective campaigns.
